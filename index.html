            </div>
        <p>The new iPhone costs approximately $600. About 4 million iPhones are sold per month. This means that in a given month we might expect Apple to have 2.4 billion dollars in <strong>revenue</strong> from the iPhone. But that money is not all profit. We have to subtract all of the <strong>costs</strong> of production to find Apple's monthly profit.  
        </p> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Profit</strong> is revenue minus cost.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are two types of cost.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Marginal costs (MC)</strong> are the costs of producing each iPhone.</li>
            <li><strong>Fixed costs (FC)</strong> are costs incured on a regular basis regardless of how many phones are sold. For example, employee salaries and facility costs are fixed costs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <strong>demand curve</strong> shows the relationship between the <strong>price</strong> of an item and the quantity demanded, the number of iPhones people are willing to buy. To make things simple for this example we will assume the demand curve is linear. 

        <p>Use the tool below to find the price that will maximize Apple's profit. Try changing the values of the intercept, marginal costs, and fixed costs. Then discuss the questions below.</p>
        
        

        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <p class="slider-label">Intercept: $ <span id="intercept">1300</span></p>
            <div id="slider_intercept" class="slider"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <p class="slider-label">Fixed cost (FC): $ <span id="fixed_cost">20</span></p>
            <div id="slider_fixed_cost" class="slider"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <p class="slider-label">Marginal Cost (MC): $ <span id="marginal_cost">200</span></p>
            <div id="slider_marginal_cost" class="slider"></div>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-6">
                <div id="chart-area"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-6">.col-md-4</div>
        </div>



        <h3>Discussion questions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>What is the meaning of the intercept of the demand curve?</li>
            <li>Suppose the intercept is $1200, fixed cost is ----, and marginal cost is 300. How much should Apple charge for the iphone to maximize their profits?
            <li>Which of the three varables have no effect on the price that achieves the maxium profit?</li>
        </ol>
